Name: **Cruz, Kathryn Angel S.**  
Section: **2ECE-A** 
## Intended Learning Outcomes  
1. To identify the codes and functions needed in cleaning and visualizing data
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program that will be used in data wrangling and data visualization
## Instructions:  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Download the ECE Board Exam 2 dataset found on this link: [bit.ly/ECEBoardExamDataset](url) and write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter notebook in the dedicated submission bin.

## **ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM**
